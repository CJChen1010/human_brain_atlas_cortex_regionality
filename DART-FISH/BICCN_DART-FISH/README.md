I used this repository to documents codes to make plots of BICCN DART-FISH datasets. The cell subclasses called in each area were stored in whole_tissue fold and the DART-FISH_plots.ipynb documents the codes to crop ROI in each area. The cell subclass in the ROI of each area was also stored in the ROI folder.
